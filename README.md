## PSeInt Practice

This repository contains a collection of coding challenges written in Spanish with PSeInt pseudocode, a tool designed for learning algorithm logic and pseudocode concepts.

The goal of this repository is to practice and improve algorithmic thinking using PSeInt. The challenges vary in difficulty and cover a wide range of algorithmic problems, from basic loops and conditionals to more complex logic like recursion and array manipulation.
